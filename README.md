# ttt2-role-alch
This is a custom role for TTT2 called the Alchemist.
They are an Innocent role that 'brews' potions over time that give benefits when thrown.


CURRENT PROGRESS:
There is now a HUD element! It displays the timer left on making a potion.

This rolecurrently has 4 different potions. Every 25 seconds, a random one is chosen and given to the player. This occurs 5 times during the round.

The potions function as grenades, meaning you must throw them to use them.

The potios are: Healing Potion, Armor Potion, Speed Potion, and Jump Potion. The speed and jump ones grant temporary boosts, the healing one heals, and the armor potion grants 15 points of body armor



FUTURE PLANS:
Make it so HUD only displays whole numbers.
Add more potions
Look into being able to choose which potion you are making.
