# ttt2-role-alch
This is a custom role for TTT2 called the Alchemist.
They are an Innocent role that 'brews' potions over time that give benefits when thrown.


CURRENT PROGRESS:
There is now a HUD element! It displays the time left on making a potion as well as how many potions are left to make

This role currently has 4 different potions. Every 25 seconds, a random one is chosen and given to the player. This occurs 5 times during the round.

The potions function as grenades, meaning you must throw them to use them.

The potions are: Healing Potion, Armor Potion, Speed Potion, and Jump Potion. The speed and jump ones grant temporary boosts, the healing one heals, and the armor potion grants 15 points of body armor



The timers and potion effects now all have ConVars! Edit things easily from the comfort of your ULX menu!


FUTURE PLANS:
Look into being able to choose which potion you are making.
