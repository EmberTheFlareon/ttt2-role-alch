# ttt2-role-alch
This is a custom role for TTT2 called the Alchemist.
They are an Innocent role that 'brews' potions over time that give benefits when thrown.


CURRENT PROGRESS:
Alchemist appears ingame, albeit without a proper icon. They do correctly have an identifying ring on them like the Detective does, though!

Timer doesn't seem to be working right.

Healing Potion is almost finished! Need to tell it to play sound, but otherwise it is functional.


NEXT STEP:
Get the timer to give another potion working correctly.

FUTURE PLANS:
Once Alchemist is soundly working, add a Traitor role variant called the Witch.
Have them appear as an Alchemist to everyone but fellow Traitors, adding a Defective-esque layer of distrust.

Adopt a system akin to Imposter's ability to cycle through sabotage stations, but for potion selection. 
After getting a cycle-able potion menu working, turn random potion selection into a toggle. This way, servers can choose which method they'd prefer.
