# ttt2-role-alch
This is a custom role for TTT2 called the Alchemist.
They are an Innocent role that 'brews' potions over time that give benefits when thrown.


CURRENT PROGRESS:
Alchemist is functional, however not perfect. It could use a HUD element to display the timer that gives potions. 


It currently has 4 different potions. Every 25 seconds, a random one is chosen and given to the player. This occurs 5 times during the round.

The potions function as grenades, meaning you must throw them to use them.

The potios are: Healing Potion, Armor Potion, Speed Potion, and Jump Potion. The speed and jump ones grant temporary boosts, the healing one heals, and the armor potion grants 15 points of body armor
